# JAVA EXERCISES

## Synopsis

Java Programs from Coding Interviews.

## Motivation

I wanted to have a series of exercises that are asked in interviews.

## PRE REQUIERMENTS

- Java SE Development Kit 8 

## EXERCISES
- Exercise01AnagramImperativeProgramming
    - Check if 2 strings are anagrams using the Imperative Programming way. Space characters are not considered.
    - Example: 	S1 = "deudora", S2 = "eduardo", S3 = "funeral", S4 = "real      fun"
    
<br />

- Exercise02AnagramDeclarativeAndImperativeProgramming
    - Check if 2 strings are anagrams using the Declarative and Imperative Programming way. Space characters are not considered.
    - Example: 	S1 = "deudora", S2 = "eduardo", S3 = "funeral", S4 = "real      fun"
    
<br />

- Exercise03AnagramDeclarativeProgramming
    - Check if 2 strings are anagrams using the Declarative Programming way. Space characters are not considered.
    - Example: 	S1 = "deudora", S2 = "eduardo", S3 = "funeral", S4 = "real      fun"
    
<br />

- Exercise04AnagramImperativeProgramming
    - Write a function that takes in an array of strings as its argument and then print all the anagrams found in the array. 
    - INPUT: {"eat", "tea", "funeral", "raza", "frog", "elvis", "real&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fun",
			"lives", "deudora", "dog", "ate", "eduardo", "zara"}
    - OUTPUT: [tea, ate, raza, lives, deudora, funeral, eat, real&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fun, eduardo, elvis, zara]
    
<br />

- MyStackTest
    - Create a Custom Stack that works like Stack and Deque (ArrayDeque) classes with the push and pop methods.

<br />

- Exercise00CreateStreams
    - Several ways to create a Stream.
    
<br />

- Exercise01ArraysStream
    - From an array of strings, print only the strings that start with 'S' in ascending order uppercased.
    - INPUT: { "Steve", "Svetlana", "sara", "John", "paul" }
    - OUTPUT: SARA STEVE SVETLANA
    
<br />

- Exercise02ArraysStream
    - Square each number in an array and print the average.
    - INPUT: { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 }
    - OUTPUT: 44.0
    
<br />

- Exercise03ArraysStream
    -  The following exercise comes from:
       [Letter Count Test](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/20782/java-guild-meeting-52018/streams---practice)
    - Now, starting again from a list of names, give me the total number of letters in all the names with more than 5 letters.
    - INPUT: { "Steve", "Svetlana", "sara", "John", "paul", "Ramiro", "Amanda", "Courtney",
			"Hubert" }
    - OUTPUT: 34
